                <p>
                     Web development process for creating a
                     website that focuses on aesthetic factors like layout,
                      user interface and other visual imagery in order to make 
                      website more visually appealing and easy to use. Web design 
                      makes use of various programs and tools in order to achieve
                       the intended look, such as Dreamweaver, Photoshop and many 
                       others. In order to create a winning design, Web designers
                        need to think about their audience, the purpose of the
                         website and the visual appeal of the design.
